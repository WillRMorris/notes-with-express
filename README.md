  ## Description
  this project makes use of render and express.js to save notes persistantly on a server. I made this project to all the taking of notes without the use of local storage, so that said notes could be accessed anywhere.

  ## Installation
  one doesn't need to instal to access. it can be found at https://notes-with-express.onrender.com/ but seeing as how this is my personal version, the repo can be cloned or copied to create your own personal version. in order to use consistently, it will need to  be set up with render as well.

  ## Usage
  ![images of functioning site](public\images\note-taker-app-pic.png)
